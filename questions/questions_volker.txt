- how to make package pip installable (PyPi)
- add entry point.
    - use __main__.py with argparse? Where to store __main__.py? in mwr_raw2l1/, i.e. at level of README, LICENSE, etc? or in mwr_raw2l1/mwr_raw2l1/?
    - use pyproject.toml? But need optional arguments, possible/sensible?
- make dependency optional, e.g. colorlog
- dependency resolution with poetry is extremely slow (~15 min) for my pyproject.toml
    - how to speed this up?
    - cannot drop python 3.6.8 support
- HUB review RUNNING TESTS/DEPLOYMENT This required installation of another package poetry â€“ which requires a large number of additional packages -
    so it would be good if this part could be modified so we can use setup.py instead as this would align better with existing test/deployment.
    - if the package was pip-installable, could this solve the issue for needing poetry
