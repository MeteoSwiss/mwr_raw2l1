General:
- check program flow and if it is not too much procedural, functional or unstructured

Specific to programming:
- having a Measurement class without methods but functions in measurement_helpers
   - when making these methods of class instance I cannot call them anymore with classmethod
- idem for scan_to_timeseries. attached to Measurement or as function in measurement_helpers
- Measurement with derived classes instead of classmethod
- measurement_helpers.make_dataset: code copy with shape_act = ... and following line (ca 44-45 and 52-53)
- would it make sense to go make writer classes instead of functions?
- read_all function besides reader classes for RPG. does this make sense here?

Specific to organisation:
- why requirements.txt and setup.py along with pyproject.toml (in ELDAmwl)
- what to do with th following after updating pyproject.toml?
   - poetry.lock is out of date: Run poetry lock, poetry lock --no-update or poetry update

specific to deployment:
- MetOffice runs python 3.6. I know it is > EOL, but can take them years to update so should make sure we can run on it
    - how can we find out which package requirements must be specified in pyproject.toml for this?
- how to make package pip installable (PyPi). Can maybe also ask Augustin for this
