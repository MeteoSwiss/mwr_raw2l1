- add variable scanflag: 1 for scanning, 0 for zenith. Makes it much easier to filter for zenith (not strictly 90deg)
- quality_flag:
    - set=0 in each bit for ok, so that a total value == 0 means all good
    - add second variable quality_flag_missing to define which flags are only 0 because tests are not executed
    - met_valid_flag should also have 0 for ok instead of 1 to be consistent with quality flag
- drop attributes in global_atts.yaml under per_instrument_aux_accuracy for E-PROFILE
    - if they shall be kept in data format, consider adding the same for IR sensor
- date format in seconds for MWR (quasi-standard) but in days for other data
- t_amb:
    - Shall we have 1 single T_amb or 1 for each receiver? write values of T_amb_1 into this for now.
    - why encoding t_amb with L1 at all? In the end we don't want to go back to raw signal (would also need gain param)
    - long_name: Ambient_target_temperature -> Ambient target temperature
- tb:
    - long_name: Brightness temperatures -> Microwave brightness temperatures
- air_pressure:
    - units: Pa -> hPa (makes sense in line with use of GHz, um, mm/h, ...)
- global attrs:
    - type_of_automatic_calibrations_performed -> type_of_automatic_calibrations
where to get the following data from:
- time_bounds: must know integration time from somewhere
- t_rec: not in data for RPG
- n_sidebands (dimension) and its variables sideband_count, sideband_IF_separation, maybe freqshift
