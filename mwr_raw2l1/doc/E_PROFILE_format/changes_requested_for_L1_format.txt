- add variable scanflag: 1 for scanning, 0 for zenith. Makes it much easier to filter for zenith (not strictly 90deg)
- quality_flag:
    - set=0 in each bit for ok, so that a total value == 0 means all good
    - add second variable quality_flag_missing to define which flags are only 0 because tests are not executed
    - met_valid_flag should also have 0 for ok instead of 1 to be consistent with quality flag
- drop attributes in global_atts.yaml under per_instrument_aux_accuracy for E-PROFILE
    - if they shall be kept in data format, consider adding the same for IR sensor
