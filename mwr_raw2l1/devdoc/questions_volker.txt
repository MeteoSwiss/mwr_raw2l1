General:
- check program flow and what is too much procedural of functional or unstructured

Specific to programming:
- having a Measurement class without methods but functions in measurement_helpers
   - when making these methods of class instance I cannot call them anymore with classmethod
- idem for scan_to_timeseries. attached to Measurement or as function in measurement_helpers
- Measurement with derived classes instead of classmethod
- measurement_helpers.make_dataset: code copy with shape_act = ... and following line (ca 44-45 and 52-53)

Specific to organisation:
- why requirements.txt and setup.py along with pyproject.toml (in ELDAmwl)
- what to do with th following after updating pyproject.toml?
   - poetry.lock is out of date: Run poetry lock, poetry lock --no-update or poetry update
- read_all function besides reader classes for RPG. does this make sense here?
