General:
- check program flow and what is too much procedural of functional or unstructured

Specific to programming:
- having a Measurement class without methods but functions in measurement_helpers
   - when making these methods of class instance I cannot call them anymore with classmethod
- idem for scan_to_timeseries. attached to Measurement or as function in measurement_helpers
- split measurement_helpers to two files, one for generating dataset, one for transforming scan? how to name/organise?

Specific to organisation:
- why requirements.txt and setup.py along with pyproject.toml (in ELDAmwl)
