This repository contains tools for reading brightness temperatRures as well as housekeeping and auxiliary data from the
most prominent types of operational ground-based V- and K-band microwave radiometers for humidity and temperature
profiling. The read-in data can be output to NetCDF files. A configuration for producing a NetCDF according to the
